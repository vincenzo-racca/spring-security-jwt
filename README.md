## Securing your REST APIs with Spring Security and JWT

This project contains a Maven project about the Spring Security with JWT.

The project has two classed to configure Spring Security with JWT (these two classes are exclusive). \
The main class is **com.vincenzoracca.springsecurityjwt.security.SecurityConfig**. This configuration is for versions the same or later than Spring Boot 2.7.0. \
Alternatively, if you need to use a version prior to Spring Boot 2.7.0, you can use the class **com.vincenzoracca.springsecurityjwt.security.SecurityConfigOld**.
